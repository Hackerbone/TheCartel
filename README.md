# Secret Task Force - Wireframe (IECSE)

> Developer : S Sitaraman (a.k.a hackerbone), Team ID : 57744 (Solo)

- Designed a responsive Cartel themed minimalist website for the given prompt. The website is hosted currently on netlify. [Site Link](https://stf-hackerbone.netlify.app/)

- Frameworks and Software used : ReactJS, Sass (Scss), Figma

- The webpage was created using custom CSS, no bootstrap and is mobile responsive (Yup iPhone 5/SE as well)

- One of the things I found was that only on iPhones the view port is a bit zoomed, tried to use meta tags for that but did not work. It works perfectly on iPhones if the screen is pinched to zoom out. This issue occurs in iPhones only since the `100vh` height includes the URL Bar and the bottom navs in browsers like chrome/safari etc.

## Here are some snapshots of the website
